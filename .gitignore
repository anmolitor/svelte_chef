# This file tells git which file paths should not be checked into version control.
# In general, this should be all generated files, since generating them from scratch avoids consistency issues.

# 'package-lock.json' for example, IS checked into version control although it is generated, 
# since it locks the version of dependencies for reproducable builds
# (which package.json does not do - in general it is a good practice to allow patch upgrades without needing to increment the version each time).
